# :warning: Maintenance Notice

Unfortunately, the original author, Afnanksalal, has abandoned and archived the project. The goal of this fork is to rewrite the project to optimize it and add more customization. You can find more information on why PteroVM is no longer being developed by reading this [comment](https://github.com/afnan007a/Ptero-vm/issues/32#issuecomment-1282276839).
